### Direct Upload with Progress Bar | [Download](https://github.com/viddler/Examples/zipball/upload-progress)

A collection of files that will extend the direct upload form by submitting the form to an iframe in order to allow you to use AJAX in order to build a proper progress bar.

This example can be found in the `all` branch as well as the `upload-progress` branch if you only want to grab this example.

You will need to have a Viddler API key and update the the `progress.php` and `index.php` page with your Viddler username and password to run this example.
