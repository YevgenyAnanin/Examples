### Direct Upload

Two files that will show an example of upload a file directly from your site to Viddler and a simple callback script to get the video id or errors returned.

### Direct Upload using cURL

This is a simple example of how you can still transmit files to viddler from server to server instead of directly from consumer to our servers. If you like to upload the files to your server first, you still can. The file included in this example will allow you to upload that file to us using cURL and mimicking submitting a traditional HTML form.

***

### Direct Upload with Progress Bar

A collection of files that will extend the direct upload form by submitting the form to an iframe in order to allow you to use AJAX in order to build a proper progress bar.

You will need to have a Viddler API key and update the the `progress.php` and `index.php` page with your Viddler username and password to run this example.

You can view the working example [here](http://public.supportserver.viddler.com/upload-progress/).
