### Direct Upload | [Download](https://github.com/viddler/Examples/zipball/direct-upload)

Two files that will show an example of upload a file directly from your site to Viddler and a simple callback script to get the video id or errors returned.

This example can be found in the `all` branch as well as the `direct-upload` branch if you only want to grab this example.

You will need to have a Viddler API key and update the the `index.php` page with your Viddler username and password to run this example.
