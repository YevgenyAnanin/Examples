### Direct Upload using cURL | [Download](https://github.com/viddler/Examples/zipball/direct-upload-curl)

This is a simple example of how you can still transmit files to viddler from server to server instead of directly from consumer to our servers. If you like to upload the files to your server first, you still can. The file included in this example will allow you to upload that file to us using cURL and mimicking submitting a traditional HTML form.

This example can be found in the `all` branch as well as the `direct-upload-curl` branch if you only want to grab this example.
